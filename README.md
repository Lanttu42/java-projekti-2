# School project
This is a school project. I am not a qualified Javascript enthusiast so do not copy my trusty code and hope that it will safe your day. It wont. It will possible make it even worse. Be nice and if you feel like you must comment my work, be gentle. I only do this for the grades - not to take over the world like some purple things would do...

# java-projekti-2
In this project we will use AJAX to fetch the data from the web. This time the data is not a static file, but rather a stream of data returned by a live server.

# Main goals of this project
- Project will be published in GitHub and deployed to Netlify.
- Comment every line of JavaScript code you write.
- DO not use external libraries.
- Use CSS-styles to style your page.
- All event handlers should be added dynamically! no hard coded onclick -listeners!

# The Rules are simple...
"The project work should be returned in GitHub and Netlify by deadline. Return GitHub linki in Canvas. 
Do not copy copy from internet or from someone else. Code will be checked against plagiarism."

Uhm..Ok So ... Yeah. The AJAX XML calls are pretty much the same always, but I do my best not to put some mixed ingredients.

# Application requirements
- Must be able to select something and search
- Page uses the data from the API to modify layout (graphs or images)
- Layout should be nice - who is the judge?
